# Cab-Market-Analysis Using Excel

Attached in this file are three data sources:
1) Consumer Panel Data - A sum of Amount(Dollars), Transactions and Users for each City & Company (Pink Cab/Yellow Cab). 
     Example: If 10 people took 15 rides and spent a total of $165 in one week/company/market, the Dollars would be $165, Transactions 15, and Users 10. The Average Selling Price (ASP) would be $165 (Dollars)/ 15 (Transactions) = $11
     This fictional data has been sourced from a 7-8 million person Consumer Panel which contains ALL of the spending (cash, credit, debit, mobile payments) for those consumers

2) Appendix A - Population - The population of all the cities (as we defined them) in the Consumer Panel within this case study

Questions to answer in a separate word document:
What trends and conclusions can you draw about the cab market and Pink Cab/Yellow Cab? (Most important) (30-40 minutes)
What biases could be in the data? (10 Minutes)
Could you correct for any of them currently? If not, what other data would you need? Note: you do not need to actually correct for any of the biases, if you find any. Just lay out how you would (10 Minutes)
What other datasets would you want to add? (5-10 minutes)
